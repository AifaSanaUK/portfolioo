# How to Start Your Portfolio

## Step 1: Start the Server (Backend)
Open a terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
cd C:\Users\aifas\OneDrive\Desktop\portfolio
npm run server
```
Or:
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

The server should start on http://localhost:5000

## Step 2: Start the Client (Frontend)
Open a NEW terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
cd C:\Users\aifas\OneDrive\Desktop\portfolio
npm run client
```
Or:
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The website will automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Step 3: View Your Portfolio
Once both are running, open your browser and go to:
**http://localhost:3000**

## Quick Start (Both at once)
If you want to run both server and client together:
```bash
cd C:\Users\aifas\OneDrive\Desktop\portfolio
npm run dev
```

## Important Notes:
- Make sure MongoDB is running before starting the server
- The server runs on port 5000
- The client runs on port 3000
- Keep both terminals open while using the portfolio
